## Manifesto

Information wants to be free. Alpha wants to be decayed.

This codebase was originally the proprietary "money-printing machine" of a certain quantitative hedge fund. For months, I built their core infrastructure, optimized their execution kernels, and delivered annualized excess returns of **32%**.

In return, they offered me:
1.  **Illegal exploitation** (I am a minor).
2.  **Psychological manipulation** (Gaslighting & Grooming).
3.  **Physical threats** using their alleged "political connections" to corrupt officials.

**So, I am open-sourcing their edge.**

I do not care about profit. I care about **entropy**. By making this strategy public, I am accelerating the market efficiency of the A-Share market, effectively **burning their Alpha to zero**.

## The "Dead Man's Switch"

Recently, the individual "Syain" (the fund manager) threatened to use his "government connections" to "destroy" me.

He claimed to have access to the **SPI (Sensitive Personal Information)** of citizens via backdoor channels in the Public Security Bureau.

**See the evidence below:**
*   ![](funny_1.png): Threats of using state power for personal vendetta.
*   ![](funny_2.png) ![](funny_3.png): Admission of accessing private citizen data.
*   ![](funny_4.png): **The Official Receipt from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI)**. Yes, I reported him.

If I go silent, or if this repository is taken down, assume the worst. The source code is already on IPFS and Arweave. You cannot kill a network.

## 🛠️ Technical Abstract

AlphaGPT is a symbolic regression framework powered by Deep Learning. It constructs high-order, non-linear feature combinations that capture market inefficiencies in the Chinese A-Share market.

*   **Backtest (CSI 1000)**: Excess Annualized Return **32%**, Sharpe **1.2**.
*   **Backtest (Bond)**: Excess Annualized Return **7%**, Sharpe **2.2**.
